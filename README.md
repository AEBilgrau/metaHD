metaHD
======
### Fast, efficient, and robust high-dimensional meta analysis

The package is designed to efficiently perform high-dimensional (and low dimensional) meta analysis in both dense and sparse cases. The `metaHD` package is also well-suited for graphical (or structural) meta analysis.

Installation
------------
If you wish to install the latest version of `metaHD` directly from the master branch here at GitHub, run 

```R
#install.packages("devtools")  # Uncomment if devtools is not installed
devtools::install_github("AEBilgrau/metaHD")
```

The package is still under heavy development and should be considered unstable. Be sure that you have the [package development prerequisites](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/packages/prerequisites) if you wish to install the package from the source.


Alternatives
------------
Some alternative packages for low-dimensional meta-analysis is: `meta`, `metafor`
